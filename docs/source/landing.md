## Timeserio

[timeserio](https://github.com/octoenergy/timeserio) is the missing link between `pandas`, `scikit-learn` and `keras`. It simplifies building end-to-end deep learning models - from a DataFrame through feature pipelines to multi-stage models with shared layers. While initially developed for tackling time series problems, it has since been used as a versatile tool for rapid ML model development and deployment.

## Features

* Enable encapsulated, maintainable and reusable deep learning models
* Feed data from `pandas` through `scikit-learn` feature pipelines to multiple neural network inputs
* Manage complex architectures, layer sharing, partial freezing and re-training
* Provide collection of extensible building blocks with emphasis on time series problems
